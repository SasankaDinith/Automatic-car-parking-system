<h1>ðŸš— A Smart Parking System </h1>
<p>As part of our Digital Control Systems module at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, our team successfully developed a fully automated smart car parking system that enhances efficiency and reduces the need for human intervention in parking management. This system integrates hardware components, microcontrollers, sensors, and a web-based interface to provide a seamless and intelligent parking experience.</p>
